# urlspoiler.heroku.com - Smart URL Previews

Dynamically-embedded Github Gists.  Useful for people who want to detect Gist urls on a page and then embed a preview of the Gist.  Hopefully we'll support other preview types in the future.  If you have any special requests, please submit your request in the Issues tab, or add support yourself and send a pull request.
